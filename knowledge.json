    "what is the cost of a fridge": "The cost of a refrigerator can vary widely based on several factors:\n\n1. **Type**: \n   - **Mini Fridges or Compact Refrigerators**: Prices can start from around $50 for very basic models, going up to $300 or more for slightly larger or more feature-rich models.\n   - **Standard Top-Freezer Refrigerators**: These might range from about $400 to $1,200.\n   - **Side-by-Side, French Door, or Bottom-Freezer Models**: These can start at around $1,000 and go upwards of $3,000 or more for high-end models with lots of features.\n   - **Smart Refrigerators**: Models with Wi-Fi, touch screens, and advanced features can start from $2,000 and go well beyond $4,000 or even $5,000+.\n\n2. **Brand**: Well-known brands like Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, GE, and Bosch often command higher prices due to their reputation, technology, and design. Lesser-known or store brands might offer competitive pricing.\n\n3. **Size**: A larger refrigerator, especially those designed for families or large households, will cost more due to the increased capacity and materials.\n\n4. **Features**: \n   - Energy efficiency (Energy Star certification)\n   - Ice and water dispensers\n   - Adjustable temperature zones\n   - Smart home integration\n   - Advanced cooling technologies\n   - Design elements like stainless steel or custom panels\n\n5. **Finish**: Stainless steel, black stainless, or custom panel-ready options are typically more expensive than basic finishes like white or black.\n\n6. **Energy Consumption**: More energy-efficient models might cost more initially but save money over time on electricity bills.\n\n7. **Warranty and Service**: Extended warranties or brands known for good after-sales service might also influence the price.\n\n8. **Market and Sales**: Sales, seasonal promotions, and discounts can significantly lower the cost. Black Friday, Memorial Day, and other holiday sales are popular times for deals on appliances.\n\nGiven these variables, if you're looking for a basic, no-frills fridge for a small household, you might find something suitable for $500 to $700. However, for someone interested in all the bells and whistles or a larger unit for a big family, the cost could easily exceed $2,000. Always check for current prices and sales, as prices fluctuate, and there are often good deals to be found online or in stores."
